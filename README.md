# Solo Project On LARAVEL 8

This project was made by [**Ayoube El Yazizi**](https://github.com/ayoubelyazizi).

Began the **9th** of February; deadline the **11th** of February.

## What was asked ? 

I have to create a website for my local library. The basic feature would be to list all the available books, and to create an admin system for librarian to manage the available books.

## What did i do ?
I've tried my best for 3 days but the site it's not good, there are some functionalities like: login and register with roles(admin, readers), add books and view books that was created, but the fonctionalities are 'separated', you have to put the link manually to see this, because there are a few routes problem that i don't understand, so yeah that was my worst project and i didn't like do this but i've really tried my best and at least im happy for this.

## What works manually ?

* Add books : .../librarian/books
* View books added : .../list

## What did i use ? 

* Laravel 8 
* Blade
* PHP
* Framework **Tailwind**
